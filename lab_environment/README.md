# Lab Environment Setup

## Virtual Machines

To setup the lab environment on your machine, just run

    $ vagrant up

in this directory. If you have set up your system to allow your user to
use virtualization resources on the machine, such as being in a 'libvirt'
group or equivalent, you don't need to use `sudo` or any similar mechanism
to run it as root.

If your OS or setup does not allow for running virutalization directly
as a user, run it as

    $ sudo vagrant up

This assumes `vagrant` in your PATH. If not, check your OS for how to
get Vagrant installed.

If successful, this should set up a couple of virtual machines via libvirt.

They should be accessible by name in case your operating system / libvirt setup
allows it, i.e:

    $ ssh -i deploy_key -l deploy webserver

should make it possible to SSH into the machine.

To see more information about the machines from the command line, you can use

    virsh -c qemu:///system list --all

## Ansible Collections

In some of the examinations, you will need to use Ansible collections that may
not be present in your installation of Ansible.

To download the collections you will need, run

    $ ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml

This should make the collections available for _your_ user. They will not be installed
globally.
