# Examinations

In this directory you will find the examinations that make up the basis for
grading this course.

The examinations contains one or more questions that you answer as well as you
can. Refer to the manuals of each command, and try out the commands given (if any).
Remember you have a Vagrant environment, and can destroy and recreate the
environment as much as you want to get back to the initial condition.

The lettered QUESTIONS (A, B, C, etc.) are mandatory to attempt to solve for
each examination. The BONUS QUESTIONS are there for enlightenment, and if you
answer them, it will demonstrate a good understanding of the subject which plays
into the overall evaluation and grade.

The examination labs are evaluated on both established criteria and the overall
quality of the work. This is to make sure the grades are fair and reflect the
effort and understanding of each subject per the examinations.

It is suggested that you make a separate directory to keep your examinations in.
When you work in that directory, I recommend that you name the playbooks and
other artifacts so that it's obvious which examination they belong to.

You can then commit this directory to a git repo on GitHub and then provide the link,
or make a (compressed) tar or zip file of the whole directory and send me an email
with that file.
